# Restaurant Rating Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant ratings and comprehensively analyze a restaurant dataset. 

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, perform type conversions, and encode categorical features (ordinal, one-hot, multi-label).
2. **Class Imbalance:** Address class imbalance in the 'Aggregate rating' using SMOTENC.
3. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Analyze numerical and categorical features, including distributions, correlations, top cuisines, and restaurant counts by city and country.
4. **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualize restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude.
5. **Table Booking and Online Delivery Analysis:** Explore the impact of table booking and online delivery on ratings.
6. **Price Range Analysis:** Investigate the relationship between price range and ratings.
7. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features (Restaurant Name Length, Address Length) for potential model improvement.
8. **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict ratings.
9. **Customer Preference Analysis:** Identify popular cuisines, highly-rated cuisines, and customer preferences based on votes and ratings.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Imbalanced-learn
